    "summary": "We investigate conditions under which a co-computably enumerable closed set\nin a computable metric space is computable and prove that in each locally\ncomputable computable metric space each co-computably enumerable compact\nmanifold with computable boundary is computable. In fact, we examine the notion\nof a semi-computable compact set and we prove a more general result: in any\ncomputable metric space each semi-computable compact manifold with computable\nboundary is computable. In particular, each semi-computable compact\n(boundaryless) manifold is computable.",
