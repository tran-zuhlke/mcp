    "summary": "Data science is gaining more and more and widespread attention, but no\nconsensus viewpoint on what data science is has emerged. As a new science, its\nobjects of study and scientific issues should not be covered by established\nsciences. Data in cyberspace have formed what we call datanature. In the\npresent paper, data science is defined as the science of exploring datanature.",

    "summary": "Although data science builds on knowledge from computer science, mathematics,\nstatistics, and other disciplines, data science is a unique field with many\nmysteries to unlock: challenging scientific questions and pressing questions of\nsocietal importance. This article starts with meta-questions about data science\nas a discipline and then elaborates on ten ideas for the basis of a research\nagenda for data science.",
